    <section class="section section2" id="section2">
      Our workshop is entitled, “Buddies, not Bullies”. <br>
      Our workshop occurred in Google Meet last April 14, 2021. <br>
      We had an introduction and the purpose of the workshop. <br>
      We had let them watch videos, answer questions, and a quiz. <br>
      Then after that we tackled the three sessions we had. After that, we had a Q&A. <br>
      And lastly, we gave them a short survey about our workshop.
    </section>

    <section class="section section3" id="section3">
      The purpose of our usability test is to know what they liked the most about our workshop, <br>
      if our workshop is effective, and lastly what our workshop can improve on.
    </section>

    <section class="section section4" id="section4">
      We created a quiz for our workshop. The content of our quiz is about our topic <br>
      which is cyberbullying. <br>
      We asked our participants if they are aware of cyberbullying, <br>
       if they bullied someone before, <br>
      what they felt about our workshop, and etc. <br>
      After collecting the data from our form, 15 students from Grade 9PM- 4 <br>
      from APEC Roxas and Las Piñas answered it. 
    </section>

    <section class="section section5" id="section5">
      All our participants are from 9PM-4. Participants #1, #5, #7, #8, are 14 year-old females. <br>
      Participants #3, #6, #10, #12, #13, #14 are 15 year-old females. <br>
      Participants #2, and #4 are 14 year-old males. <br>
      Lastly, participants #9, #11, and #15 are 15 year-old males.
    </section>

    <section class="section section6" id="section6">
      Our workshop lasted for less than an hour. We didn’t experience a major problem. <br>
      Participants are now well aware of the effects of cyberbullying on an individual. <br>
      But, we were able to deliver our workshop properly.
    </section>

    <section class="section section7" id="section7">
      Our workshop made another survey for the participants. <br>
      Most of our participants had a good experience in joining our workshop. <br>
      They felt excited, and informed because they learned a lot of information. <br>
      Our workshop was helpful because we gave an informative presentation. <br>
      Many have learned from our workshop, what cyberbullying is and the effects of it. <br>
      If they were to rate our workshop from 1-5, 1 as the lowest and 5 as the highest, <br>
      80% answered 5 while 20% answered 4. <br>
      Lastly, things that we can improve on our workshop is the slides and how we presented <br>
      (most of us was nervous and had technical difficulties).
